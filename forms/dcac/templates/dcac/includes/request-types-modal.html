                    The JCR wishes to ensure that the current reimbursement system for club and society funding does <b>not</b> put any students into financial difficulty, or prevent clubs and societies from being able to make larger purchases. <br><br> Therefore, the reimbursement form has been amended so that, in cases where a purchase presents itself as a financial difficulty, you may select the 'Large' option and place a request (with all the necessary information) so that college can complete the purchase for your society using a college credit card. The given amount will then be deducted from your society/club budget. 
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Standard Request</b></li>
                        <li><b>Internal Transfer:</b> for requests to departments within Downing</li>
                        <li><b>Large Request:</b> for purchases where societies are unable to directly make a purchase over Â£50. College will complete the purchase on your behalf, and deduct the given amount from your budget</li>
